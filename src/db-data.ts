        longDescription: "This UK native has entered a total of 229 Grands Prix and five world championships. With the phrase Still I Rise tattooed across his shoulders, the young racer has proved that's exactly what he's done. With one of the greatest rookie performances in F1 history in 2007, he's managed to break all expectations and cement his name as one driver not to mess with.",

        longDescription: "F1's poster boy of early achievement, Vettel has won more than all but two drivers in history by the time he was 26, including back-to-back world titles between 2010 and 2013. In the chase to the chequered flag, he likes to lead from the front and just like his hero, Michael Schumacher, Vettel has settled in as a race-winning leader at Ferrari. Alongside his four world crowns he can boast more than 50 pole positions and race victories, ranking him – statistically - above many of the biggest names in F1 history. No wonder then that he was hand-picked to return Grand Prix racing’s oldest team to glory. Since his move to Maranello, Vettel’s rivalry with Lewis Hamilton has intensified. Opposites off track – Hamilton leading a glamorous public life while Vettel is a private family man – the duo are evenly matched on Sundays as they bid not just for more world titles, but to be hailed the best of their generation.",

        longDescription: "Known for his taciturn demeanor, Raikkonen does his talking on track. His fearless racing has led to memorable McLaren wins. Out of the car, the Finn is famously taciturn. Although those who know him well say privately he is an amusing bon viveur, as well as a devoted family man. Meanwhile, his legions of loyal fans have to rely on revelations in his radio transmissions. And maybe Raikkonen himself best summed up the enigma of the Iceman when he said on the airwaves: “Leave me alone, I know what I’m doing.” ",

        longDescription: "Learning his craft on Finnish roads of ice and snow, he was born to be a Grand Prix racer. Bottas explains that if you can drive on the frozen roads of his homeland then you can drive anywhere. Then there’s the Finnish mentality–reserved, diligent and calm the fast lane of F1 doesn’t faze him. Making his F1 debut with Williams in 2013, Bottas soon became part of the family. Points and podiums followed with the reliable racer even amassing the most points without a win, a record he resented but that showcased his ability. The fact the Finn was such a points machine saw him suddenly promoted to the most coveted seat in F1 - Nico Rosberg’s vacant championship-winning seat at Mercedes. ",
